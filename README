Lively CI scripts
=================

runLivelyTests.js:
Node.js script that, once completed, will open a web browser and have it run test suites. TestRunner will write results to a CouchDB document. runLivelyTests keeps polling CouchDB for test results to show up and report them to Jenkins.

Prerequisites:
- Scriptable TestRunner
- Create Lively world that opens TestRunner and runs tests
